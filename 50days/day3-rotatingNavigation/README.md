# Rotaton Navigation

## Time it took

Nearly 3 hours or even more

## How did i manage to do

Well I still don't have transistions but at the time I'm typing this I think that I am the happiest human being on this fucking planet and now let us get on how I did it!

### Difficulties 
	One of the most tiring things was the circle after that I had issue's with rotation the whole thing back to it is initial position so you know what I did I went to pray Asar with some doubts that I will not be able to get it done, but oh boy I did fucking get it done!
	and the other problem was the circle, I couldn't manage to put the buttons on top of it in the right way

### The process
	Well starting off there is a big boi container and that big boi container is very neccasry because we can't rotate the body so when we create this container we can see the body background so that the transistion can be seen *even tho I have no transistions yet xD* so yea after that a circle div is deployed with a absolute position to the main div and 2 buttons to that circle as well I mean they must be inside the circle div and you just manipulate there top and left value and then you set something called the transform origin actually I have seen this value by mistake from the owner's code but it just sets like a rotational axe or some shit like that, and then you just set that for the content dev as well, you make you content look sexy and stuff like that add a click event on the button and then go to javascript grab both the circle and the big boi div id and then once the first button is cliccked rotate the fucking bad boi after that set the value to zero when you are done!
