### desc

I started this on Nov 01 2021  
I don't follow any course, I just look at the demo and try to go from there, If i don't understand I look at the source code and try to see what is going under the hood and yea that is it

## My End Goal

Is to build a simple website containing all of this 50 projects, and at the end of it, stream me building 5 projects a day, in 10 days and just making them look better and yea I think that Will be my end goal for this year!
